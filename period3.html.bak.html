                                <p>First of all, notice the big jump in ionic radius as soon as you get into the negative ions. Is this surprising? Not at all - you have just added a whole extra layer of electrons. Notice that, within the series of positive ions, and the series of negative ions, that the ionic radii fall as you go across the period.</p>
                                <p>In each case, the ions have exactly the same electronic structure - they are said to be isoelectronic. However, the number of protons in the nucleus of the ions is increasing. That will tend to pull the electrons more and more towards the centre of the ion - causing the ionic radii to fall.</p>

                                <p>Notice that the general trend is upwards, but this is broken by falls between magnesium and aluminium, and between phosphorus and sulphur.
                                    <br>First ionisation energy is governed by:
                                    <ul>

                                        <li>whether the electron is alone in an orbital or one of a pair.</li>

                                <p><b>The upward trend</b>
                                    <br>In the whole of period 3, the outer electrons are in 3-level orbitals. These are all the same sort of distances from the nucleus, and are screened by the same electrons in the first and second levels.
                                    <br>The major difference is the increasing number of protons in the nucleus as you go from sodium across to argon. That causes greater attraction between the nucleus and the electrons and so increases the ionisation energies.
                                    <br>In fact the increasing nuclear charge also drags the outer electrons in closer to the nucleus. That increases ionisation energies still more as you go across the period.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <br><b>The fall at aluminium</b>
                                    <br>You might expect the aluminium value to be more than the magnesium value because of the extra proton. Offsetting that is the fact that aluminium's outer electron is in a 3p orbital rather than a 3s.
                                    <br>The 3p electron is slightly more distant from the nucleus than the 3s, and partially screened by the 3s electrons as well as the inner electrons. Both of these factors offset the effect of the extra proton.</p>
                                <p>
                                    <br><b>The fall at sulphur</b>
                                    <br>As you go from phosphorus to sulphur, something extra must be offsetting the effect of the extra proton
                                    <br>The screening is identical in phosphorus and sulphur (from the inner electrons and, to some extent, from the 3s electrons), and the electron is being removed from an identical orbital.
                                    <br>The difference is that in the sulphur case the electron being removed is one of the 3px2 pair. The repulsion between the two electrons in the same orbital means that the electron is easier to remove than it would otherwise be.</p>

                                <p>Sodium has a very exothermic reaction with cold water producing hydrogen and a colourless solution of sodium hydroxide.</p>
                                <p>Magnesium has a very slight reaction with cold water, but burns in steam. A very clean coil of magnesium dropped into cold water eventually gets covered in small bubbles of hydrogen which float it to the surface. Magnesium hydroxide is formed as a very thin layer on the magnesium and this tends to stop the reaction.</p>
                                <p>Aluminium powder heated in steam produces hydrogen and aluminium oxide. The reaction is relatively slow because of the existing strong aluminium oxide layer on the metal, and the build-up of even more oxide during the reaction.</p>
                                <p>The common shiny grey lumps of silicon with a rather metal-like appearance are fairly unreactive. Most sources suggest that this form of silicon will react with steam at red heat to produce silicon dioxide and hydrogen. But it is also possible to make much more reactive forms of silicon which will react with cold water to give the same products.</p>
                                <p>Phosphorus and sulphur. These have no reaction with water.</p>
                                <p>Chlorine dissolves in water to some extent to give a green solution. A reversible reaction takes place to produce a mixture of hydrochloric acid and chloric(I) acid (hypochlorous acid). In the presence of sunlight, the chloric(I) acid slowly decomposes to produce more hydrochloric acid, releasing oxygen gas, and you may come across an equation showing the overall change:</p>

                                <p>Sodium burns in oxygen with an orange flame to produce a white solid mixture of sodium oxide and sodium peroxide.</p>
                                <p>Magnesium burns in oxygen with an intense white flame to give white solid magnesium oxide.</p>
                                <p>Aluminium will burn in oxygen if it is powdered, otherwise the strong oxide layer on the aluminium tends to inhibit the reaction. If you sprinkle aluminium powder into a Bunsen flame, you get white sparkles. White aluminium oxide is formed.</p>
                                <p>Silicon will burn in oxygen if heated strongly enough. Silicon dioxide is produced.</p>
                                <p>White phosphorus catches fire spontaneously in air, burning with a white flame and producing clouds of white smoke - a mixture of phosphorus(III) oxide and phosphorus(V) oxide. The proportions of these depend on the amount of oxygen available. In an excess of oxygen, the product will be almost entirely phosphorus(V) oxide.</p>
                                <p>Sulphur burns in air or oxygen on gentle heating with a pale blue flame. It produces colourless sulphur dioxide gas.</p>
                                <p>Despite having several oxides, chlorine won't react directly with oxygen. Argon doesn't react either.</p>

                                <p>Sodium burns in chlorine with a bright orange flame. White solid sodium chloride is produced.</p>
                                <p>Magnesium burns with its usual intense white flame to give white magnesium chloride.</p>
                                <p>Aluminium is often reacted with chlorine by passing dry chlorine over aluminium foil heated in a long tube. The aluminium burns in the stream of chlorine to produce very pale yellow aluminium chloride. This sublimes (turns straight from solid to vapour and back again) and collects further down the tube where it is cooler.</p>
                                <p>If chlorine is passed over silicon powder heated in a tube, it reacts to produce silicon tetrachloride. This is a colourless liquid which vaporises and can be condensed further along the apparatus.</p>
                                <p>White phosphorus burns spontaneously in chlorine to produce a mixture of two chlorides, phosphorus(III) chloride and phosphorus(V) chloride (phosphorus trichloride and phosphorus pentachloride). Phosphorus(III) chloride is a colourless fuming liquid. Phosphorus(V) chloride is an off-white (going towards yellow) solid.</p>
                                <p>If a stream of chlorine is passed over some heated sulphur, it reacts to form an orange, evil-smelling liquid, disulphur dichloride, S<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>.</p>
                                <p>It obviously doesn't make sense to talk about chlorine reacting with itself, and argon doesn't react with chlorine.</p>
